VMMC simulation of melting of an RNA 8-mer 
-------------------------------------------

The example provides a melting of an RNA 8-mer as an example system to study
The input file provided uses the average-base parametrization of the RNA model, note the setting of 

interaction_type = RNA

in the input file. If one wants to use the sequence dependent version of the model, the following lines also need to be included:

use_average_seq = 0
seq_dep_file = ../../rna_sequence_dependent_parameters.txt


Make sure that the location of the parameters file is specified correctly for your directory.
To evaluate the results of the simulations, you can run 
./estimate_Tm.py  last_hist.dat

which calculates melting temperature based on the extrapolations to a series of temperatures, as specified in the input file.
Note that the ratio of single to double stranded states is 1 to 2 at melting temperature because of finite size effects (see e.g. Ouldridge, Doye, Louis: J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 2010)
The scripts includes this correction when calculating the yields at different temperatures.


Finally, the generated strands are provided for the example in the sim.top and init.conf files. 
Note that in the current setup, the hydrogen bonds are only allowed between the native base pairs (The base identity in the sim.top is provided by a number rather than by a letter A,C,G, U for this 
particular example. Only bases whose identities numbers add to +3 can for a base pair).
