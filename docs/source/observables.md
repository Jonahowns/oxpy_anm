# Observables

The observable infrastructure was devised to help building customized output from *oxDNA* (and *DNAnalysis*) without having to dive in the simulation code itself. 

The relevant keys in the input file are `analysis_data_output_*` (used by *DNAnalysis*) and `data_output_*` (used by *oxDNA*). These take as an argument, between curly brackets, a series of lines that is interpreted as an input file and whose options dictate the way the resulting output file is printed. 

````{warning}
`data_output_i` (with `i` integer) will not be taken into consideration if all `data_output_j` for `j < i` are present. The same holds true for `analysis_data_output_*`.
````

The following options are supported:

* `name`: the name of the output file. If `stdout` or `stderr` than the standard output or the standard error will be used, respectively. **Mandatory**.
* `linear`: if set to "true" then the output will be printed every `print_every` time steps. If set to "false" a log-linear scale will be used instead, where the output will be printed in linearly-spaced cycles made of log-spaced times. More specifically, the {math}`i`-th output time will be given by {math}`t_i = t_{jp} + n_0 (i - jp)^k`, where {math}`p` is the number of points per cycle, {math}`j = \lfloor i / p\rfloor` and {math}`n_0` and {math}`k` are additional parameters. Defaults to true.
* `print_every`: the number of time steps every which the output is written. **Mandatory if `linear = true`**.
* `log_ppc`: The number of points per cycle, {math}`p`. **Mandatory if `linear = false`**.
* `log_n0`: The parameter {math}`n_0`. **Mandatory if `linear = false`**.
* `log_fact`: The parameter {math}`k`. **Mandatory if `linear = false`**.
* `col_*`: an option that expects text enclosed by curly brackets that specifies the observable to be printed in the given column `*`. Note that `col_i` requires that all `col_j` with `j < i` are also present.
* `start_from`: the number of steps beyond which the output will be written. Defaults to 0.
* `stop_at`: the number of steps beyond which the output will stop being written. Defaults to -1 ("never").
* `only_last`: overwrite the content of the output with the current one.
* `update_name_with_time`: change the name of the output file every time the output is printed by appending the current simulation time step to `name`.

An example is:

```text
data_output_1 = {
	name = prova.dat
	print_every = 100
	col_1 = {
		type = step
		units = MD
	}
	col_2 = {
		type = potential_energy
	}
}
```

this will print in *prova.dat* two colums, the first with the steps in MD units (`dt`-aware) and the second with the potential energy. 


````{note}
oxDNA provides a plugin infrastructure to manage additional Observables. See the doxygen documentation for `src/PluginManagement/PluginManager.h`. The `contrib` folder contains a few working plugins you can use as starting points to write your owns.

## External observable file

Output files and observables can also be specified in an external [JSON](https://www.json.org/) file by setting the non-mandatory option `observables_file` in the [main input file](input.md#core-options). The following snippet shows an example of such a file:

```text
{
  "output_1" : {
    "print_every" : "10000",
    "name" : "hb_energy.dat",
    "cols" : [
      {
        "type" : "step",
        "units" : "MD"
      },
      {
        "type" : "hb_energy"
      }
    ]
  },
  "output_2" : {
    "print_every" : "1000",
    "name" : "pot_energy.dat",
    "cols" : [
      {
        "type" : "step"
      },
      {
        "type" : "potential_energy"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Print an [oxDNA configuration](configurations.md#configuration-file).

````{note}
This observable can be used to save disk space by generating trajectories containing only those nucleotides that are of interest (*i.e.* whose positions, orientations and possibly momenta are required for post-processing). The following example will generate a trajectory with configurations spaced by 1000 time steps containing the positions and orientations (but **not** the momenta) of the first 5 nucleotides only:


	data_output_1 = {
		name = traj_small.dat
		print_every = 1000
		col_1 = {
			type = configuration
			show = 0,1,2,3,4
			print_momenta = false
		}
	}
````

* `[PV_only = <bool>]`: if `true`, the pressure and (optionally) the stress tensor won't be divided by the volume of the simulation box. Defaults to `false`.

## Stress autocorrelation

Compute the stress autocorrelation function $G(t)$ using the multi-tau method describere [here](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3491098). This observable supports the `update_every` option.

* `[m = <int>]`: size of the average used by the algorithm. Defaults to 2.
* `[p = <int>]`: The size of the coarse-grained levels used by the algorithm. Defaults to 16.
* `[serialise = <bool>]`: if `true`, every time the observable is printed, also generate files that can be used to recreate the observable's data structures. This makes it possible to restart simulations that keep accumulating statistics for the autocorrelation. Note that if this is set to `true`, then the observable will look for these files to reload the data upon restarting. Defaults to `false`.

## Pitch

* `bp1a_id = <int>`: base pair 1 particle a id.

## Vector angle

**TEP interaction only**.

* `type = vector_angle`: the observable type.
* `[first_particle_index = <int>]`: index of the first particle on which to compute the angle with the next particle. Defaults to `0`.
* `[last_particle_index = <int>]`: defaults to the index of the first-but last bead in the same strand as the first particle. Therefore, if I have a strand of N beads, the last one will be the one with index N-2. This is because the last bead is atypical in the TEP model (*e.g.* it's aligned with the vector before it rather than the one in front of it.). index of the last particle of the chain on which to compute the angle.
* `[angle_index = <int>]`: can be `1`, `2`, or `3` depending on which orientation vector we want to compute the cosine, or 0. In that case it measures the amount of twist, defined as in the TEP model: (1 + v2.v2'+v3.v3')/(2*pi)*(1 + v1.v1') where v1, v2 and v3 are the orientation vectors of the first particle in a pair and v1', v2' and v3' are the orientation vectors of the following particle. Defaults to `1`.
* `[print_local_details = <bool>]`: if `true`, print the quantity relative to each pair of particles. Otherwise, print their average (for `angle_index = 1,2,3`) OR their sum (that is, the total twist, for `angle_index = 0`). Defaults to `true`.

## Writhe

**TEP interaction only**.

* `type = writhe`: the observable type.
* `[first_particle_index = <int>]`: index of the first particle on which to compute the angle with the next particle. Defaults to `0`.
* `[last_particle_index = <int>]`: defaults to the index of the first-but last bead in the same strand as the first particle. Therefore, if I have a strand of N beads, the last one will be the one with index N-2. This is because the last bead is atypical in the TEP model (*e.g.* it's aligned with the vector before it rather than the one in front of it.). index of the last particle of the chain on which to compute the angle.
* `[subdomain_size = <int>]`: if locate_plectonemes is `false`, defaults to the entire subchain, therefore computing the total writhe,otherwise it defaults to 35. If smaller, the writhe will be computed only on the beads between i and i+subdomain_size, for every i between `first_particle_index` and `last_particle_index` (wrapping around if go_round is true, or not computing it if the end of the chain is reached otherwise.
* `[go_around = <bool>]`: whether to assume periodic boundary conditions when building subdomains - see above. Defaults to true if the last particle is right before the first and if subdomain_size is not the entire subchain, and to false otherwise.
* `[locate_plectonemes = <bool>]`: if set to `true`, the writhe will be used to locate plectonemes with the algorithm from Vologodskii et al. "Conformational and Thermodynamic Properties of Supercoiled DNA (1992)" and the indices on beads at the center of a plectoneme loop will be printed. Defaults to `false`.
* `[writhe_threshold = <double>]`: if the writhe exceeds this, then we mark a plectoneme. Only used if `locate_plectonemes = true`. Defaults to 0.28, since this is the value that works best with a subdomain_size of 35, which is the default one.
* `[print_space_position = <bool>]`: defaults to `false`. Whether to print the position of the plectoneme tip segment in 3d space as well as its index. Only used if `locate_plectonemes = true`.
* `[print_size = <bool>]`: defaults to `false`. Whether to print the plectoneme size computed with Ferdinando-Lorenzo's algorithm. Only used if `locate_plectonemes = true`.
* `[contact_threshold = <number>]`: defaults to `5`. Segments closer than this will be considered to be touching accourding to the plectoneme size algorithm.
* `[size_outer_threshold = <int>]`: defaults to `30`. Outer threshold parameter, which substantially is the maximum separation in indices between two points of contact of a plectoneme loop, for the plectoneme size algorithm.
* `[minimum_plectoneme_size = <int>]`: defaults to `1.` Plectonemes shorter than this wont' be reported.
* `[bending_angle_number_segments = <int>]`: defaults to 0. When non-zero, the angle between that many segments surrounding the plectoneme tip will be averaged and printed on file.

## TEP contacts

**TEP interaction only**.

* `type = contacts`: the observable type.
* `[first_particle_index = <int>]`: index of the first particle to consider. All the particles coming before this one will be ignored. Defaults to `0`.
* `[last_particle_index = <int>]`: defaults to the index of the first-but last bead in the same strand as the first particle. Therefore, if I have a strand of N beads, the last one will be the one with index N-2. This is because the last bead is atypical in the TEP model (*e.g.* it's aligned with the vector before it rather than the one in front of it.). index of the last particle to consider. All the particles coming before this one will be ignored.
* `[neighbours_to_ignore = <int>]`: Number of neighbours to ignore before-after each particle. *E.g.*, if equals to 1, contacts between given first-neighbours will never be reported, if equals to 2, contacts between second neighbours will never be reported, etc. Defalts to `1`.
* `[contact_distance = <number>]`: A contact is defined if the centers of mass of the particles is lower than this value. Defaults to 1.
* `[only_outermost_contacts = <bool>]`: if `true`, contacts nested within other contacts will not be reported. *E.g.*, if the i-th monomer is linked to both the i-1-th and the i+1-th monomer, and the contacts are 10-40, 10-25, 13-32, 12-48 and 45-60, only 10-40, 12-48 and 45-60 will be reported, since 10-25 and 13-32 are both nested inside 10-40. This is only get one result per plectoneme. Watch out though, since this will report clashes between a plectoneme and the chain/other plectonemes. Telling a plectoneme and a plectoneme contact just by using the contact map might be non-trivial. Defaults to `false`.
